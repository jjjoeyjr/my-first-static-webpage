<h1 class="hd1">The Beginning</h1>
<P>
The start of video Games, actually started in science labs. In 1962, the first
ever video game was created. The game that was created was SpaceWar, it was the
first computer based space combat game. This was all done by Steve Russell of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<h2>The Blowup </h2>
<p>
From about the mid 1970's to early 1990's videos games had its ups and downs,
just like anything else that is new. A few notable things that happened during
that times was the release of the Space Invader arcade games, the first ever
third-party game developer. That company is Activison, it is one of the biggest
game developing company's today in 2023.

<h3>Modern gaming</h3>
<p>
Modern gaming is nothing like it was back in the 80's and 90's. Today, consoles
and PC gaming is over a 100 billion dollar industry. Consoles and gaming PC's
are insanely powerful, most consoles and PC's have the most stat of art
internals. The future of gaming, will continue to grow, and grow into
full body virtual reality, where it feels like you are actually in the game.
